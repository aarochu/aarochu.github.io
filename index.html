        <p>I am a young lad in the Bay Area. I enjoy playing basketball, video games, sleeping, eating unhealthy foods, and reading fantasy books. I was born at a very young age and lived in Cali for all of my life(Cali baby). I want to be an software engineer when I grow up but also get connected to basketball as much as possible. My favorite movies are in the <a href="https://www.starwars.com/">Star Wars</a> and <a href="https://www.marvel.com/">Marvel</a> series and some Disney Movies. I hope you enjoyed reading this and remember, don't take life too seriously. Nobody gets out alive anyways🙄.
